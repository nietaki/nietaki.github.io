My name is Jacek Kr√≥likowski, I'm a software engineer from Warsaw, Poland. 
After graduating from the University of Warsaw I moved to London, where I went
from working in Microsoft to doing [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) in startups.
I'm now building the future of payments at [Curl](https://paywithcurl.com/).

I'm always happy to chat about software engineering, photography and 
[BJJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu).
