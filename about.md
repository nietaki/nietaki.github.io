My name is Jacek Kr√≥likowski, I'm a programmer from Warsaw, Poland. In 2014 I have graduated from the University
of Warsaw and moved to London to work for Skype. I'm now building the future of payments at [Curl](https://paywithcurl.com/).

Wanna get in touch? Send me an email at *nietaki@gmail(d0t)com* (make sure you replace the "(d0t)"
 in the address with a ".") or try an appropriate link from the footer ;)
