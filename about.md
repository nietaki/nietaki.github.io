My name is Jacek Kr√≥likowski, I studied Computer Science 
at the University of Warsaw and now live in London where I went from working in Microsoft to 
doing [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) in startups.

I'm always happy to chat about software engineering, photography, making music and 
[BJJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu).
