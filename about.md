My name is Jacek Kr√≥likowski, I'm a programmer from Warsaw, Poland. In 2014 I have graduated from the University
of Warsaw and moved to London to work for Skype. I now do backend engineering at an amazing startup called
[Mainframe](https://mainframe.com/).

In my spare time I do some more coding, climb at [The Arch](http://www.archclimbingwall.com/#intro) or cycle around London.

Wanna get in touch? Send me an email at *nietaki@gmail(d0t)com* (make sure you replace the "(d0t)"
 in the address with a ".") or try an appropriate link from the footer ;)
