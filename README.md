# the Almost Done blog Jekyll migration [![Built with Spacemacs](https://cdn.rawgit.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/442d025779da2f62fc86c2082703697714db6514/assets/spacemacs-badge.svg)](http://spacemacs.org)

I decided to move my blog from the age-old, insecure, complicated and ugly wordpress install to something simple and easy to work with so that I could focus on the contents more. 

For now there are ~~no comments~~, no fancy galleries, categories and tags, just a series of posts.

## Theme
The theme is very slightly modified official Jekyll version of the Clean Blog theme by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). It's incredibly simple, clean and nice to work with. Hats off!

## How to run (in case I forget)
1. Install node (from its website)
1. `brew install ruby`
1. `sudo gem install jekyll jekyll-redirect-from jekyll-gist jekyll-sitemap jekyll-paginate`
1. `jekyll serve --watch`
