Towards the end of November I gave a flash talk at the
[London Elixir Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Elixir-London/).
This time I was talking about the journey from `println` debugging to 
proper tracing and bringing Erlang tools to Elixir programmers.

You can watch the talk here:

...and here are [the slides](http://slides.com/nietaki/tracing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants):

The resulting [Rexbug](https://github.com/nietaki/rexbug) project is ready to
be used but there's still some [issues](https://github.com/nietaki/rexbug/issues)
I could use some help on - some should even be suitable for Elixir beginners.
