TIL that the [Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License](http://www.wtfpl.net/)
has [not been approved by the OSI board](https://opensource.org/minutes20090304),
not because it was vulgar, but because it wasn't a license - it was a
dedication to the public domain.

Also, if you do want to put your work in public domain, 
[you're probably better off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL#Discussion)
using the
[CC0 license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#Seven_regularly_used_licenses).
