There's a bunch of projects that make my life a whole lot of better. I can only
preach about them to my friends so much, so here's some links to spread the word
otherwise. Worst case scenario they'll get a SEO bump ;)

### Workfowy

[Workfowy](https://workflowy.com/invite/2148a9f5.emlx) (warning, reflink)
is an amazingly simple, yet powerful lists notebook (?). The lists
can be arbitrarily nested, the items can be (un)completed back and forth and
the whole thing works brilliantly both on web or on mobile, with offline
synchronization. All quick and dirty plans go on there.

### 1Password

[1Password](https://1password.com/) is the password manager I use ever since
I abandoned LastPass after they locked me out of my acount for a day or so.
It integrates beautifully with OSX and alright with Windows. I might consider
switching to [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) at one point in time, but
I'm verry happy with it for now.

### Spotify

Spotify is the best thing since sliced bread and I've been subscribed to the
paid version for as long as I've been able to. Almost all of the music I might
want and beautiful social/playlist management.

 of my playlists :D

### Spacemacs

[Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) is a weird editor. It feels like vim, is
built on Emacs and has a lot of community configuration in it out of the box.
It requires [**a lot** of configuration](https://github.com/nietaki/dotty-dotfiles/blob/master/files/.spacemacs)
and getting used to, the learning curve
is a lot like that of EVE Online, but when the dust settles it's
the most comprehensive editor for people who don't like to use their mouse too
much.

(yes, the axis on this image don't completely make sense)

### Death to Stock

[Death to Stock Photo](https://deathtothestockphoto.com/) is a newsletter that
sends out some beautiful, ryalty-free images to people every once in a while,
Some of the backgrund images on this blog (including the one in this post)
have been taken from them.
