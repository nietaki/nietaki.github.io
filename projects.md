# In Progress

## [Rexbug](https://hex.pm/packages/rexbug)

A thin Elixir wrapper for `:redbug` production-friendly Erlang tracing debugger.
It tries to preserve `:redbug`'s simple and intuitive interface while making it
more convenient to use by Elixir developers.

# Done

## [Crawlie the crawler](https://github.com/nietaki/crawlie)
A simple Elixir library for creating decently-performing crawlers with minimum effort.
Written mainly to understand GenStage, Flow, and the process of publishing a package on [hex.pm](https://hex.pm/).

## [Boggle Cracker](https://github.com/nietaki/BoggleCracker)
A C# CLI tool to crack a game of [Boggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle).
Given a word dictionary and a "board" state, under half a second lists all words that are possible
to find, sorted from most to least valuable. Written as part of coding interviews
preparations :)

## [my reddit saved items](http://myredditsaveditems.herokuapp.com/)
A more convenient way to browse and filter your reddit saved items. Playing with
the Reddit API and deploying a Play! Framework app to Heroku. Source code [here](https://github.com/nietaki/myRedditSavedItems)

## [dotty dotfiles](https://github.com/nietaki/dotty-dotfiles)
The simplest way I could find to have settings synchronised between computers and
to set up a new OSX machine.

## [the What What What](https://github.com/nietaki/HWO-2014---the-What-What-What)
My entry for the [2014 Hello World Open](https://2014.helloworldopen.com/about) competition, written in python.
Placed 4th (IIRC) in the Europe & Africa region.

# Almost Done
*(this is where abandoned projects go to ~~die~~ never be picked up again)*

## [Erlang Editor](https://github.com/nietaki/erlangEditor)
A curses-based console collaborative editor proof of concept. I wrote it to wrap
my head around Erlang and OTP.

## [faceSwapper](https://github.com/nietaki/faceSwapper)
A Play! Framework / [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) app that given a link to a picture
generates a version of it with all the faces replaced with
[trollfaces](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trollface-coolface-problem).
Doing it seemed important at the time...

## [band_name_generator](https://github.com/nietaki/band_name_generator)
I still might go and extract the logic from it and rewrite it one day when I create a band ;)
