*([here](http://nownownow.com/about)'s a description what a "now page" is for)*

I'm in London, building [Mainframe](https://mainframe.com/), doing a lot of
[Elixir](http://elixir-lang.github.io/) and AWS and starting to look at
[golang](https://golang.org/) - we might be using it in the future for our
product...

I also released the first version of [Rexbug](https://hex.pm/packages/rexbug)!
I'm very happy about it and I want to get it feature complete ASAP.
