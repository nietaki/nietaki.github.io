*([here](http://nownownow.com/about)'s a description what a "now page" is for)*

I'm in London, working on [Mainframe](https://mainframe.com/)'s new features. 
Starting to investigate the caveats of creating distributed apps in [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/).

While waiting for an unlucky wrist injury to get better so I can go back to climbing regularly I'm giving in to my first gaming addiction since Counter Strike 1.6 and Team Fortress 2: [PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds](http://store.steampowered.com/app/578080/PLAYERUNKNOWNS_BATTLEGROUNDS/) - playing duo with a friend is just too much fun :D
